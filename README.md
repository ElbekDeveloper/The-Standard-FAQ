# The-Standard-FAQ

## 1. I was looking otripleS solution you are directly exposing  domain entities but in my development career I was using viewmodel or DTOâ€™s can you explain us when to use ViewModel or DTO?

DTO approaches assume that the APIs are responsible for populating audit fields, ids ... etc.

But in reality there are scenarios where you want to let the consumer control these fields. Like a migration scenario for instance. You can't force maintaining certain audit fields like created and updated dates without Hacking into the database and by passing your API because of the DTO model.

## 2. How to name a branch my branch and my PR?

- Branch Naming Convention:

users/[github-username]/[Issue-type/category]-[entity]-[action]

Look at this video at the 25:10 mark https://youtu.be/mR0N-QxZqYY?t=1510

It helps you search branches and help you focus on one thing at a time.

- Commit, Issue and PR naming convention:
DATA: Add RefugeeContact Model
BROKERS: Insert Refugee
CONTROLLER: POST Refugee
How to do a Pull Request the right way ?

If possible the PR name should reflect an open issue's name. Be careful of case. All caps for the main category, and capitalized for the title (like a news article title), and separated by colon. Most of the time we want the issue, the commit and the PR to share the exact same name.


## 3. Why should I be careful with the commit history of my PR?

It's better to have only one commit, per initial PR, showing the implementation of one feature. This way people can easily replicate your work, in the future, by looking at all the files you had to change to resolve an issue.

## 4. How to start contributing to a project?
